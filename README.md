# Query_refinement

## Abstract
Diversity, group representation, and similar needs often apply to query results, which in turn require constraints on the sizes of various subgroups in the result set. Traditional relational queries
only permit conditions as part of the query predicate(s), and result subgroup size constraints are difficult or impossible to specify. In this paper, we study the problem of modifying queries to have the result satisfy constraints on the sizes of multiple subgroups in it.
This problem, in the worst case, cannot be solved in polynomial time. Yet, with the help of provenance annotation, we are able to develop a query refinement method that works quite efficiently, as
we demonstrate through extensive experiments.
